## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone,  **without the help of Google**:

-   What is vi
-   Who is Bill Joy
-   [The basic vi commands](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/TvhnXN1GAP7Et5OSuceGqw "The basic vi commands")
    -   How to start and exit vi
    -   What are the command and insert modes, and how to switch from one to the other
    -   Edit text
    -   Cutting and pasting lines
    -   Searching forward and backward
    -   Undo
    -   Quitting

## Requirements
-   Allowed editors: vi
-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what this project is about
-   If the answer of one of the following questions needs the  `Return`  key, then use the string  `<Return>`. Example: What is the command to write current contents to a file named in the original vi call? The answer should be exactly  `:w<Return>`. Note that there is no space between  `w`  and  `<Return>`
-   Your file should only contain the command, and nothing else
